# The HDF Group
The ultimate plan is to make this the new destination for [www.hdfgroup.org](https://www.hdfgroup.org) and the other web properties of The HDF Group. Much of this site has been assembled to quickly replace portal.hdfgroup.or which held our documentation and download archives. 

Our **non-profit mission** is to ensure efficient and equitable access to science and engineering data across platforms and environments, now and forever.

People around the world rely on open source HDF software and use it to solve some of the most challenging data management problems.
